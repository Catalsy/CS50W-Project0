                        Domestic cats are smaller than wildcats in both skull
                        and limb measurements. Adult domestic cats typically
                        weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 10lb). Some breeds,
                        such as the Maine Coon, can occasionally exceed 11 kg
                        (24 lb). Conversely, very small cats, less than 2 kg
                        (4 lb), have been reported. The world record for the
                        largest cat is 21 kg (50 lb). The smallest adult cat
                        ever officially recorded weighed around 1 kg (2lb).

                        vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae
                        (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable
                        number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only
                        vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).

                        The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very
                        large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw. Within
                        the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and
                        tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers
                        a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth,
                        inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and
                        severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.

                    <td>
                        Like almost all members of the Felidae, cats have
                        protractable and retractable claws. In their normal,
                        relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin
                        and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws
                        sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground
                        and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the
                        fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind
                        feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or
                        more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or
                        self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction
                        on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their
                        front paws, and four on their rear paws
