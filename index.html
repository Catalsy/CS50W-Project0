                The cat or domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.
                It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.
                The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet; or a feral cat,
                freely ranging and avoiding human contact. A house cat is valued
                by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents.
                About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a
                strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable
                claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are
                most active at dawn and dusk. Cats can hear sounds too faint or
                too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice
                and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in
                the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better
                sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being
                solitary hunters, are a social species. Cat communication
                includes the use of vocalizations including mewing, purring,
                trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific
                body language. Cats also communicate by secreting and
                perceiving pheromones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn,
                with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic
                cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby
                known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats
                by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, has
                resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide,
                contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and
                evoking population control.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in
                Egypt, because cats in ancient Egypt were venerated since around
                3100 BC. However, the earliest indication for the
                taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was found in Cyprus,
                where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic
                grave dating to around 7500 BC. African wildcats were
                probably first domesticated in the Near East. The leopard
                cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in
                China around 5500 BC, though this line of partially
                domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat
                populations of today.
            </p>

                As of 2007, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet
                in the U.S. by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish.
                As of 2010, it was ranked the third-most popular pet in the UK,
                after fish and dogs, with around 8 million being owned.
